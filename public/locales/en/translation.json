As of block height 844799, UTC time 2021-07-06T09:19:01, a total of 3,519 epochs (currently 240 blocks per epoch). \\n\\n# Conclusion\\nThe difficulty adjustment strategy of the consensus algorithm is in line with expectations, and the actual block generation time can be very close to the target time. \\nThe uncle block rate is relatively stable and the network is in good condition. \\n\\nBut because the initial uncle block rate target is too large (240‰), the uncle block rate during this period has not reached the target, but the block generation speed has been adjusted to the minimum value of 5 seconds. Now it is decided to adjust the target of uncle block rate to 100‰ through on-chain configuration. \\n\\n# Impact\\nAfter the uncle block rate target is adjusted to 100‰, when the uncle block rate of a certain epoch exceeds 100‰, the block generation target time of the next epoch will automatically increase until the uncle block rate is less than 100 ‰. According to the above statistical results, the block generation time after adjustment will be greater than 5 seconds. \\nStarcoin's block reward will be automatically adjusted according to the block time, so after the block time is greater than 5 seconds, the block reward will increase proportionally. However, due to the reduction of the uncle block rate target, the part of rewarding uncle blocks will be reduced, this part will be affected, and the speed of STC's PoW issuance will be slightly reduced. \\n\\n# Proposal information\\nProposal id: 2\\nInitiating account: 0xb2aa52f94db4516c5beecef363af850a\\nTransaction 0xc126c0df93aa3ffbb6aac9f9fb35ac98e0525d883bcf5e2cd574c921111f325a\\nChange the value of the other configuration item 0x1::Conus_Config from the unchanged target 0x1::Conus_sensus to 100:Conus_Config.\",\"id\":2,\"link\":\"https://github.com/starcoinorg/starcoin/discussions/2675\",\"status\":4,\"title\":\"[OnChainConfig]uncle rate target\",\"for_votes\":\"0\",\"against_votes\":\"0\",\"end_time\":\"1626262357931\",\"type_args_1\":\"0x1::OnChainConfigDao::OnChainConfigUpdate<0x1::ConsensusConfig::ConsensusConfig>\"},{\"creator\":\"0xb2aa52f94db4516c5beecef363af850a\",\"description\":\"With the growing demand for Move deployment in the Starcoin ecosystem, Starcoin plans to initiate a new proposal to officially open the Move contract.
